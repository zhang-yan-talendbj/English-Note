<STRONG>Overengineering</STRONG> (or <B>over-engineering</B>) is design of a product to be more robust or complicated than what is necessary for its application, either (charitably) to ensure sufficient <A title="Factor of safety" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_of_safety">factor of safety</A>, sufficient functionality, or because of design errors. Overengineering is desirable when safety or performance on a particular criterion is critical, or when extremely broad functionality is required, but it is generally criticized from the point of view of <A title="Value engineering" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_engineering">value engineering</A> as wasteful. As a <A class=mw-redirect title="Design philosophy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_philosophy">design philosophy</A>, such overcomplexity is the opposite of the <A title=Minimalism href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism#Minimalist_design">less is more</A> school of thought (and hence a violation of the <A title="KISS principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</A> and <A class=mw-redirect title=Parsimony href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimony">parsimony</A>).
