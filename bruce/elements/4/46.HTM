<H2><SPAN class=mw-headline id=What_is_incremental_reading.3F><FONT class=extract><SPAN id=Introduction>What is incremental reading?</SPAN> </FONT></SPAN></H2>
<P><FONT class=extract>Incremental reading is a learning technique that makes it possible to </FONT><A class="external text" href="http://wiki.supermemo.org/index.php?title=Incremental_reading_marketed_dishonestly" rel=nofollow><FONT class=extract>read thousands of articles at the same time</FONT></A><FONT class=extract> without getting lost. Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall of the processed texts. The review process is handled by the proven <I><A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/english/ol/background.htm">spaced repetition</A></I> algorithm known as the <B><A title=SuperMemo href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/SuperMemo">SuperMemo method</A></B>. </FONT></P>
<DIV class=inset style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff99">

<P><FONT class=extract><B>Warning!</B> Incremental reading may seem complex at first. However, once you master it, you will begin a learning process that will surpass your expectations. You will be surprised with the volume of data your memory can process and retain! </FONT></P>
<H2><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Advantages_of_incremental_reading><SPAN id=Advantages>Advantages</SPAN> of incremental reading </SPAN></H2>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Massive_learning>Massive learning </SPAN></H3>
<P>Possibility of studying a huge number of subjects at the same time. In traditional reading, one book or academic subject might need to be completed before studying another. With incremental reading, there is virtually no limit on how many articles you can study at the same time. Only the availability of time and your memory capacity will keep massive learning in check </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Creativity_.28the_association_bonus.29>Creativity (the association bonus) </SPAN></H3>
<P>The key to creativity is an association of remote ideas. By studying multiple subjects in unpredictable order, you will increase your power to associate ideas. This will immensely improve your creativity. Incremental reading may be compared to brainstorming with yourself. In the long run, the greatest creative advantage comes from knowledge permanently stored in your memory (as opposed to knowledge that requires Google). It is only a matter of creative effort and invested time before different pieces of knowledge can be associated to form new quality. </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Understanding_.28the_slot-in_factor.29>Understanding (the slot-in factor) </SPAN></H3>
<P>One of the limiting factors in acquiring new knowledge is the barrier of understanding. All written materials, depending on the reader's knowledge, pose a degree of difficulty in accurately interpreting their contents. This is particularly visible in highly specialist scientific papers that use a sophisticated symbol-rich language. A symbol-rich language is a language that gains conciseness by the use of highly specialist vocabulary and notational conventions. For an average reader, symbol-rich language may exponentially raise the bar of lexical competence (i.e. knowledge of vocabulary required to gain understanding). Incremental reading makes it possible to delay the processing of those articles, paragraphs or sentences that require prior knowledge of concepts that are not known at the moment of reading. The processing of the learning material will only take place then when the new information begins to slot in comfortably in the fabric of the reader's knowledge. Incremental reading makes it possible to tackle the hardest material that might normally seem unreadable </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Counteracting_entropy>Counteracting entropy </SPAN></H3>
<P>The web is a goldmine of information. However, rarely do we find step-by-step articles that provide all information and entirely satisfy our needs. In scientific research, acquiring engineering knowledge, studying a narrow topic of interest, etc. we are constantly faced with a chaos of disparate and often contradictory statements. Incremental reading makes it possible to resolve contradictions and build harmonious models of knowledge on the basis of the information chaos drawn from the Internet. Incremental reading <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=stochastic" rel=nofollow>stochastically</A> <A class="external text" href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=juxtapose" rel=nofollow>juxtaposes</A> pieces of information coming from various sources and uses the associative qualities of human memory to emphasize and then resolve contradiction </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Stresslessness>Stresslessness </SPAN></H3>
<P>The information era tends to overwhelm us with the amount of information we feel compelled to process. Incremental reading does not require all-or-nothing choices on articles to read. All-or-nothing choices are stressful! <I>Can I afford to skip this article? For months I haven't had time to read this article!</I> etc. SuperMemo helps you prioritize and skip articles partially or transparently. Oftentimes, reading 3% of an article may provide 50% of its reading value. Reading of articles may be delayed transparently, i.e. not by stressful procrastination but by a sheer competition with other pieces of information on the basis of their priority. In incremental reading, instead of hesitating or procrastinating, you simply prioritize </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Attention>Attention </SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental reading widely stretches the span of your attention. You will notice that a single paragraph in an article may greatly reduce your enthusiasm for reading. If you stumble against a few frustrating paragraphs, you may gradually develop a dislike of reading a particular article. You may even become fed up with reading for the entire evening. Incremental reading makes it possible to immediately move on to other pieces of information reducing the negative impact of frustration. It also makes it possible to split larger pieces into less intimidating portions. It allows you to read interesting bits before reading the boring bits. Those measures dramatically increase your attention. They also make reading fun. A skilled incremental reader is likely to develop an addiction to learning with all related benefits! </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Consolidation>Consolidation </SPAN></H3>
<P>Incremental reading combines the process of extracting pieces of valuable knowledge with memory consolidation. By the time you begin a standard spaced repetition process of well-formulated items (as in classical SuperMemo), your memory will often have already been established in a favorable context (i.e. context that makes remembering easier). This comes from the need to extract a given piece of information from a larger body of knowledge that provides your items with relevant context. This slow process of jelling out knowledge provides you with an enhanced sense of meaning and applicability of individual pieces of information. In addition, semantically equivalent pieces of information may be consolidated in varying contexts adding additional angles to their associative power. In other words, not only will you remember better. You will also be able to view the same information from different perspectives </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Prioritization>Prioritization </SPAN></H3>
<P>In incremental reading, you can precisely determine the <A title="Priority queue" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority</A> of each article, paragraph, sentence or question. This will maximize the value of your reading time. This will also reduce the impact of material overflow on retention. You will always remember the desired proportion of your top-priority material. While the lesser priority material may suffer more from the overflow and be remembered less accurately. Priority of articles is not set in stone. You can modify it manually while reading. The priority will also change automatically each time you generate article extracts. It will change if you delay or advance scheduled reading. The priority of extracts is determined by the priority of articles. The priority of questions and answers produced from individual sentences is determined by their parenting extracts. Multiple prioritization tools will help you effectively deal with massive changes in your learning focus </P>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Fun>Fun </SPAN></H3>
<P>The sense of productivity might be one of the most satisfying emotions. This is why incremental reading is highly enjoyable. This only magnifies its powers. To experience the elation of incremental reading, you may need a few months of focused practice. You will first have to start with the basic tools and techniques listed in this article. Then you will need to master <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">knowledge representation skills</A>. Finally, you will need a couple of months of heavy-load incremental reading to perfect the details and develop your own "incremental reading philosophy". Last but not least, incremental reading requires good language skills, some touch-typing skills, and patience (SuperMemo will often want you to go against your own intuition). Although the material is originally imported from electronic sources, it always needs to be molded, shortened, provided with context clues, restructured for wording and grammar, etc. The skills involved are not trivial and require practice. In contrast to classical SuperMemo, where you focus on the review of the old material, incremental reading interweaves the old with the new. Novelty adds to the fun and efficiency of learning </P>

<P>Here is a simplified algorithm for reading articles: </P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Choose an article</B>: Import an article as explained earlier or bring up previously imported articles with <B><A title=Learn href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Learn">Learn</A></B> (<I>Ctrl+L</I>).&nbsp;<B>Learn&nbsp;</B>will display only articles imported&nbsp;in the past. If&nbsp;you import an&nbsp;article, and want to have&nbsp;it shown later&nbsp;during a learning session on the same day, you must place it in the outstanding queue (e.g. <B>Learning&nbsp;:&nbsp;Later today </B>on the element menu, <I>Ctrl+Shift+J</I>, etc.). If you import many articles, and you want to process them all on the same day, you must place them all in the outstanding queue (e.g. open the articles in the browser, and choose <B>Learning&nbsp;:&nbsp;Spread</B>). The simplest and the recommended way is to do basic article processing immediately after importing (e.g. it is important to give articles appropriate priority to make sure valuable articles do not disappear in the crowd). Most of the time you can rely solely on <B>Learn</B> to schedule articles optimally for review. 
<LI><B>Click the article</B> to enter editing mode, in which you can modify text, select fragments, etc. 
<LI><B>Start reading</B> the article from the top 
<LI><B>Extract texts</B>: If you encounter an interesting text in the article, select it with the mouse and choose <B>Reading&nbsp;: Remember extract</B> on the <A title="Component menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">Component menu</A> (or simply press <I>Alt+X</I>). Alternatively, you can click the green T icon on the <B>Read</B> toolbar (<A class=image title="SuperMemo: Remember extract button on the Read toolbar" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Topic_memorized.gif"><IMG height=16 alt="SuperMemo: Remember extract button on the Read toolbar" src="http://help.supermemo.org/images/8/84/Topic_memorized.gif" width=16></A>) or on the <A title="Element toolbar" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_toolbar">Element toolbar</A>. This operation will introduce the extracted fragment into the learning process as an independent mini-article. If you would like to specify the priority of the new extract, choose <B>Reading&nbsp;: Schedule extract</B> (checked T icon on the <B>Read</B> toolbar) instead of <B>Remember extract</B>. Also, if you have an impression that the article is difficult and you would like to read some fragments later, extract those fragments with <B>Reading&nbsp;: Schedule extract</B> and provide a review interval that will reflect the time you believe you will be better equipped to understand the extracted fragment. 
<LI>Optionally, if you read a fragment that seems unimportant, then select it (e.g. with the mouse) and either delete it (e.g. with the <I>Del</I> key) or mark it with the <I>ignore</I> font. To mark it with <I>ignore</I> font, choose <B>Reading&nbsp;: Ignore</B> on the <A title="Component menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">Component menu</A> (or click the stop-sign icon on the <B>Read</B> toolbar). 
<LI>Optionally, if the selected fragment does not include all the important reading context, you will need to add this context manually. For example, if you are learning history, you may extract the following fragment from an article about Lincoln: <I>On Sept. 22, 1862, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, one of the most important messages in the history of the world. He signed it Jan. 1, 1863.</I> If you would like to extract the fragment related to signing the Emancipation Proclamation, you will need to change <I>He</I> to <I>Lincoln</I> and <I>it</I> to <I>Emancipation Proclamation</I> so that your stand-alone fragment is understandable: <I>Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863.</I> You can use the <B>Reference</B> options on the <A title="Component menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">Component menu</A> to easily add context to your extracts (see: <A title=References href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">References</A>). Context added by <B>Reference</B> will be added automatically to all extracts of a given article. For example, select the text that you want to serve as the reference title of all extracts and choose <B>Reference&nbsp;: Title</B> on the <A title="Component menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">Component menu</A> (or press <I>Alt+T</I>). This text will appear at the bottom of all extracts (in reference pink font by default). 
<LI><B>Mark your last reading point</B>: Once you decide to stop reading the article before its end, mark the last processed fragment as the read-point (e.g. with <I>Ctrl+F7</I> or by choosing <B>Reading&nbsp;: Read-points&nbsp;: Set read-point</B>). Next time you come back to this same article, SuperMemo will highlight your read-point and you will be able to resume reading from the point you last stopped reading the article. To go to your current read point, press <I>Alt+F7</I>. If you forget to set a read-point, SuperMemo will leave a read-point at the place of your last extract. 
<LI><B>Go to the next article</B>: After you finish reading a portion of one article, choose <B>Learn</B> or <B>Next repetition</B> to proceed with reading other articles. Those buttons are located at the bottom of the <A title="Element window" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_window">Element window</A>. You can also use <I>Enter</I>, which will work as long as the selection in the text is not empty (e.g. marked as a reading point), or if you have left the editing mode (e.g. with <I>Esc</I>). If the text selection is empty, <I>Enter </I>will add a new line in the text (as is the case with other standard text editors). 
<LI><B>In incremental reading, interrupted reading is a rule, not an exception!</B> (see advantages <A href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Advantages">above</A>)<BR>With a dose of practice, you will quickly get accustomed to this not-so-natural state of affairs and learn to appreciate the power of the incremental approach. Use the following criteria to decide when to stop reading the article: 
<UL>
<LI><B>lack of time</B>: if you still have many articles for review for a given day and your time is running out, keep your increments shorter. After some time, being in a hurry will be a norm and you will tend to read only 1-2 paragraphs of each article and dig deeper only into groundbreaking articles that will powerfully affect your knowledge. 
<LI><B>boredom</B>: if the article tends to make you bored, stop reading. Your attention span is always limited. If your focus is poor, you will benefit more from the article if you return to it after some break. Go on to reading something that you are not yet tired of. If SuperMemo schedules the next review at a date you consider too late, use <A title="Keyboard shortcuts" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcuts"><I>Ctrl+J</I></A> or <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> to adjust the next review date. 
<LI><B>lack of understanding</B>: if you feel you need more knowledge before you are able to understand the article, postpone it (e.g. use <I>Ctrl+J</I> or <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> and schedule the next review in 100 days or so). If you believe you have already imported articles with relevant explanatory knowledge, you can search for these articles (e.g. with <I>Ctrl+F</I>) and review or advance these articles now (e.g. with browser's <B><A title="Processing multiple elements (Process collection/branch/browser)" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Processing_multiple_elements_%28Process_collection/branch/browser%29">Learning</A>&nbsp;: Review all</B> or <B>Advance&nbsp;: Topics</B>). If you have not yet imported any explanatory articles, you could do it now (e.g. search the web and <A href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_reading#Importing_articles">import articles</A> as explained before). Note that you can select a piece of text in SuperMemo and use <I>Ctrl+F3</I> to search encyclopedias or dictionaries for more material on a given subject. 
<LI><B>lower priority</B>: read lower priority articles in smaller portions thus reducing the overall time allocation for the related subject. </LI></UL>
<LI>Once you complete reading the entire article and have extracted all the interesting fragments, press <I>Shift+Ctrl+Enter</I> (or <B>Learning&nbsp;: Done</B> on the <A title="Element menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu">Element menu</A>). This will dismiss the article, i.e. remove it from the review process, and delete the contents of the processed article (without deleting the extracted material). <B>Done</B> will delete a childless article (i.e. an article that did not provide interesting extract or whose extracts have been processed and moved to various <A title=Categories href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Categories">Categories</A>). Using <B>Done</B> will greatly reduce the size your collection and eliminate "dead hits" when <A title="Search menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Search_menu">searching</A> through your collection. </LI></OL>
<P><B>Warning!</B> Some texts rich in pictures and tables may be handled with difficulty by SuperMemo. It may be very useful to learn to use HTML filters (press <I>F6</I>). See: <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/help/faq/html.htm">Problems with HTML</A>. Some of those problems stem from bugs in Internet Explorer that SuperMemo employs to display and edit HTML. This particularly refers to Internet Explorer 6. It is therefore highly recommended you install Internet Explorer 7 or later to make your life easier. With a dose of patience, you will learn to work around these problems. </P>

<P>In the course of traditional reading, we often mark important paragraphs with a highlighter pen. In SuperMemo, those paragraphs should be extracted as separate mini-articles (elements) that will later be used to refresh your memory. Each extracted paragraph or section becomes a new element that will be subject to the same reading algorithm as discussed above. Extract important fragments and single sentences with <B>Remember extract</B> (<I>Alt+X</I>). Remember to add necessary context to make sure that the extracted fragment does not become meaningless with time. You can use the <B>Reference</B> options on the <A title="Component menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Component_menu">Component menu</A> (esp. <I>Alt+Q</I>) to easily add context to your extracts. For example, select the title of the source article and press <I>Alt+T</I> (<B>Reference&nbsp;: Title</B>). This way, each extract will be marked by the title of the source article. If you fail to provide the context, you can use the reference link button (<A class=image title="SuperMemo: Reference button on the element toolbar" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Reference_button.gif"><IMG height=16 alt="SuperMemo: Reference button on the element toolbar" src="http://help.supermemo.org/images/9/9e/Reference_button.gif" width=16></A>) on the <A title="Element toolbar" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_toolbar">Element toolbar</A> to jump to the source article from which the extract was produced. </P>

<P>SuperMemo will show you that extracting important fragments and reviewing them at later time will have an excellent impact on your ability to remember and benefit from your learning material. However, it will also show that once the time between reviews increases beyond 200-300 days, reading and re-reading (<A title=Glossary href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary#passive_review">passive review</A>) will often result in insufficient recall of the material. For this reason, sooner or later, you will need to use <B>Remember cloze</B> by selecting text that you wish to remember and pressing <I>Alt+Z</I> (or clicking the blue Z icon (<A class=image title="SuperMemo: Remember cloze button on the Read toolbar" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/File:Remember_cloze_button_%28Read_toolbar%29.gif"><IMG height=16 alt="SuperMemo: Remember cloze button on the Read toolbar" src="http://help.supermemo.org/images/2/24/Remember_cloze_button_%28Read_toolbar%29.gif" width=16></A>) on the <B>Read</B> toolbar or on the <A title="Element toolbar" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_toolbar">Element toolbar</A>). <B>Remember cloze</B> will help you convert a sentence into a series of questions with answers.

<P>you may discover that when review intervals become long enough, you may not actually be able to recall the name of the ARPA agency or even forget the year in which the Internet started.

<LI><B>understandability</B>: "<I>the ARPA agency</I>" phrase may defy grammar rules you have learned in primary school, but it is by far more understandable than just <I>the ARPA</I>. In SuperMemo, understandability is more important than stiff rules of grammar or spelling! </LI></OL>
<P><B>Remember:</B> </P>
<UL>
<LI>As a rule, you should <B>use only one-sentence extracts to generate cloze deletions</B>! Some people hate incremental reading in the beginning. Monster clozes are the #1 reason for such a negative feeling. By using one-sentence extracts for cloze deletions, you will save ages on repetition time and eons on time needed to simplify clozes and converting them to the final form based on the minimum information principle. See: <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules</A> 
<LI>Your work on extracting fragments, producing cloze deletions and editing them should also be incremental. <B>In each review, do only as much work on the learning material as is necessary!</B> Extracting and editing in intervals adds additional benefit to learning and is more time-efficient. Each time you rethink structure and formulation, you hone the representation and "connectivity" of a given piece of knowledge in your memory. In addition, your priorities change as you proceed with learning. At times, you will over-invest your time in a piece of knowledge that quickly becomes irrelevant or out-dated. The incremental approach will reduce the impact of over-investment. Incrementalism should then be used not only while reading, but also in the follow-up processing and formulation of knowledge 
<LI>To better understand incremental reading at this stage, it is recommended you read: <A title="Items, topics and tasks" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Items,_topics_and_tasks">Topics vs. Items</A> </LI></UL>
<H3><SPAN class=mw-headline id=Skill_4:_Repetition_and_review>Skill 4: <SPAN id=Review>Repetition and review</SPAN> </SPAN></H3>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/english/smintro.htm">SuperMemo is based on repetition</A>. You make repetitions of the learned material in order to ensure that your knowledge retention (i.e. your ability to recall facts) reaches the desired level (usually 95-98%). </P>
<P>In SuperMemo, incrementally processed articles will also be subject to repetition. We will often use the more intuitive term <I>review</I> in reference to incrementally processed material; after all, when you resume reading an article after a certain interval of time, you are not actually repeating anything. You are simply reading new sections of the same material and extracting newly acquired wisdom into separate elements with <I>Alt+X</I> (i.e. <B>Remember extract</B>). </P>
<P>The algorithms that determine the timing of (1) repetitions of question-and-answer material and (2) reviewing reading material are analogous but not identical. Most importantly, all repetitions and article presentations happen in increasing intervals by default. In incremental reading, you will see a constant inflow of new articles into your collection. Unprocessed material will need to compete with the newly imported material. Increasing review intervals make sure that your old material fades into lower priority if it is not processed quickly. The speed of processing will depend on the availability of your time and the value of the material itself. Articles that are boring, badly written, less important for your work or growth, will receive smaller portions of your attention and may go into long review intervals before you even manage to pass a fraction of the text. That is an inevitable side effect of a voluminous flow of new information into your collection and into your memory. However, intervals and priorities can easily be adjusted. If the priorities change, you can modify the way you process important articles. At review time, you can either read the entire article without interruption, or revert it to a shorter interval. You can manually change its priority (e.g. with <I>Alt+P</I>). You can also use search tools (e.g. <I>Ctrl+F</I>) to locate more articles on the subject that you feel you have neglected. You can reprioritize a bunch of articles by changing their priority; you can shorten their interval or review them all when needed (see <A title="Processing multiple elements (Process collection/branch/browser)" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Processing_multiple_elements_%28Process_collection/branch/browser%29">subset operations</A> in the <A title=Browser href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Browser">Browser</A>). </P>
<P>The algorithm for reviewing questions and answers (e.g. cloze deletions) is quite complex and limits your influence on the timing of repetitions (see: <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/english/algsm11.htm">SuperMemo Algorithm</A>). This is to ensure a high level of knowledge retention, which might be compromised by manual intervention. </P>
<P>However, the algorithm for determining inter-review intervals in incremental reading is much simpler and is entirely under your control. Each article receives a specific priority. The priority determines which articles are reviewed first and which can be postponed in case you run out of time. Each article is also assigned a number called the <A title=Glossary href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary#A-Factor">A-Factor</A> that determines how much intervals increase between subsequent reviews. For example, if A-Factor is 2, review intervals will double with each review. Priority and A-Factors are set automatically, but you can change them manually at any time. Both are determined heuristically on the basis of the length of the text, the way it is processed, the way it is postponed or advanced, and by many other factors. Long texts will receive low A-Factors (e.g. 1.1), while short extracts will receive higher A-Factors (e.g. 1.8). Manually typed texts have higher priority and lower A-Factors than automatically imported texts. You can change the priority and A-Factor of an article by pressing <A title="Keyboard shortcuts" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcuts"><I>Alt+P</I></A>. You can also use <I>Shift+Ctrl+Up</I> and <I>Shift+Ctrl+Down</I> to increase or decrease an element's priority. Note that A-Factors associated with items cannot be changed by the user, as they are a reflection of item difficulty that determines the length of optimum inter-repetition intervals (see: <A title="Forgetting index" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Forgetting_index">Forgetting index</A>). </P>
<P>You can control the timing of article review by manually adjusting inter-review intervals. Use <I>Ctrl+J</I> (<B>Reschedule</B>) or <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> (<B>Execute repetition</B>) to determine the date of the next review. <I>Ctrl+J</I> will increment the current interval, while <I>Shift+Ctrl+R</I> will first execute a repetition and then set the new interval. For example, if your current interval is 100 and you specify the value of 3 in <B>Reschedule</B>, your new repetition date will be set in 3 days, and the last repetition date will not change (if the repetition was to occur today, your new interval will be 103). If you do the same with <B>Execute repetition</B>, your new interval will be 3 and the last repetition date will be set to today. In other words, <B>Reschedule</B> increments the interval (it can also shorten intervals), while <B>Execute repetition</B> sets the length of the interval. Note that <B>Reschedule</B> executed during the repetition cycle will first complete the repetition and will have the same effect as <B>Execute repetition</B>. </P>
<P>In heavily overloaded incremental reading, you will often want to learn only a portion of material related to a given subject. For that purpose, read about the priceless concept of <A title="Subset learning (Learn vs. Review)" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Subset_learning_%28Learn_vs._Review%29">subset learning</A>. </P>

<P>In incremental reading, you may quickly import and produce more learning material than you can effectively process. To make sure that your learning does not suffer from overload, you should use the <I>priority queue</I>. Using <I>Alt+P</I> (<B>Learning&nbsp;: Priority&nbsp;: Modify</B> on the <A title="Element menu" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Element_menu">Element menu</A>), you can set each element's priority from 0% to 100%. Remember that 0% corresponds with high priority while 100% with low priority. By default, your outstanding repetitions will be auto-sorted from high to low priority. This way, if you fail to complete your daily load of learning, it will only be the lower priority material that will suffer. Also by default, at the beginning of your working day (i.e. at your first run of SuperMemo), your outstanding material from previous days will be be auto-postponed (again with high-priority material being least affected). </P>

<P><A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/english/sms.htm"><B>Older SuperMemos</B></A>: In the years 1987-1998, users of SuperMemo had only two alternatives in the area of collecting learning material for learning with SuperMemo: (1) type it in and formulate it manually or (2) obtain ready-made learning material from colleagues, SuperMemo Library, etc. The only way SuperMemo supported learning from electronic sources was via <B>Copy</B> and <B>Paste</B>. </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/soft/sm99.htm"><B>SuperMemo 99</B></A> made the first step towards efficient reading of electronic articles by introducing <A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/read.htm">reading lists</A> and the first primitive reading tools: extracts and clozes. Reading lists are prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts make it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions. Clozes make it possible to convert short sentences into question-answer format by means of <A title=Glossary href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Glossary#cloze_deletion"><I>cloze deletions</I></A>. </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/articles/soft/sm10.htm"><B>SuperMemo 2000</B></A> greatly increased the efficiency of reading by introducing the concept of <B>incremental reading</B>. Incremental reading makes it possible to simultaneously read dozens of articles. Each article is read in small increments fully controlled and prioritized by the user and/or the default learning process. Components of incremental reading introduced in SuperMemo 2000: new A-Factor-based topic repetition scheme (i.e. learning algorithm), read points, formatting in extracts and in clozes (SuperMemo 99 would ignore formatting), text highlights, source article link, reading toolbar, subset learning, subset postpone, and support for longer articles (SuperMemo 99 was limited to 64K articles). </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2002.html" rel=nofollow><B>SuperMemo 2002</B></A> brought incremental reading to a new level. For SuperMemo 2002 incremental reading become the primary learning mode for middle-level and advanced students. SuperMemo 2002 introduced <A title="HTML component" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/HTML_component">HTML-based</A> incremental reading. For the first time, the user would see little difference between the material in his web browser and in SuperMemo. Other new features introduced by SuperMemo 2002: <A title="Import web pages" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Import_web_pages">wholesale learning material import</A> from Internet Explorer, mid-interval repetitions that make it possible to review portions of material without damage to the learning process (<A class="external text" href="http://supermemo.com/english/algsm11.htm">Algorithm SM-11</A>), search-based learning (i.e. subset learning in which the subset is defined by advanced search tools), dynamically modified A-Factors that fine-tune the priorities without user intervention, <A title=Postpone href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Postpone">postpone wizard</A> that makes reading lists obsolete, separate topic/item statistics and new incremental reading progress statistics, reference labeling, and more. </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2004.html" rel=nofollow><B>SuperMemo 2004</B></A> has been developed solely with the view to perfecting the tools used in incremental reading. The data collected from months of actual incremental reading have been instrumental to enhancing the algorithm and the tools. Fine tuning of the modification of topic A-Factors enhances the optimization of new material review in a heavily overloaded process. New tools include: rich statistics for monitoring and optimizing the learning process, tools for handling excessive delays in review, browsing sources of extracts and clozes, one-key reference labeling, proliferating remote images, easy integration of remote images, and more. </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2006.html" rel=nofollow><B>SuperMemo 2006</B></A> made a major step in rationalizing the overload of the learning material in incremental reading by introducing the <A title="Priority queue" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Priority_queue">priority queue</A>. It makes it easier to import articles from the Internet (esp. from <A class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/" rel=nofollow>Wikipedia</A>). Material overload is handled with auto-postpone and auto-sort tools. SuperMemo 2006 simplifies importing, arranging, compressing, converting, zooming, and trimming pictures. SuperMemo 2006 can now pick any folder on your hard disk and convert all your file archives into material that can be processed incrementally (e.g. article archives, picture archives, family albums, movie clips, documentation files, or assorted archives). SuperMemo 2006 also makes it simple to do one-key searches and import of auxiliary learning material on the web with customizable tools (e.g. Google, encyclopedias, dictionaries, picture archives, etc.). </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2008.html" rel=nofollow><B>SuperMemo 2008</B></A> extends incremental reading into the areas of pictures, sounds and video (see: <A title="Visual learning" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Visual_learning">Visual learning</A> and <A title="Incremental video" href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Incremental_video">Incremental video</A>). Imports from the web, esp. Wikipedia and YouTube are now simpler, and make it easy to set priorities, references, categories, etc. SuperMemo 2008 also simplifies and automates the process of creating <A title=References href="http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/References">learning material references</A>. </P>
<P><A class="external text" href="http://www.super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo15.html" rel=nofollow><B>SuperMemo 15</B></A> improves the following: web imports (e.g. eliminating duplicates), splitting articles (e.g. automatic splitting of wikipedia articles into separate topics), handling of references, and more. As SuperMemo 15 provides a full Unicode support, incremental reading in languages other than English should be much easier. </P></DIV>

<P><B>Question:</B> </P>
<P><I>Adam asked:</I> </P>
<P>When I press <B>Learn</B> I get <I>Nothing More to Learn</I> instead of the articles I just imported. These instructions do not explain what I'm actually supposed to do for the 'choose an article' step. </P>
<P><B>Answer:</B> </P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Nothing more to learn</I> is likely to show only on Day #1. In the future, you will build up a backlog of articles and never run out of work to do. On Day #1 you can just manually go to imported articles and work with them. 
<LI><I>choose an article</I> means <I>display it in the element window</I>. Usually you will do it with <B>Learn</B> that will bring articles that need most urgent processing. Once you see an article (i.e. <I>choose it</I>), you go to the next step of the instructions (i.e. click, read, edit, extract, etc.). </LI></OL>
